# Build Targets

Ystari will target .NET Standard 2.0. Consult [this page](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/blob/master/docs/versions.md) for information on which frameworks will support .NET Standard 2.0. We also plan on targeting modern UI frameworks like XAML and (hopefully!) WebAssembly. Note that right now Ystari is targeting 1.6 because there is no 2.0 tooling available, but that should be coming in 2017.
