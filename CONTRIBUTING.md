# How to contribute

Ystari is developed and maintained by a global development team composed of volunteers. We welcome your help!

## Getting started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* We suggest this online course on [contributing to OSS projects on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
* Review the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MarimerLLC/Ystari/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist
* Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually based off the master branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that
    branch. Releases are typically in maintenance mode and accept only
    critical bug fixes. Check with the project owners before working on
    anything other than critical bug fixes.
  * Create a branch in which to do your work.  Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.

````
    #999 Make the example in CONTRIBUTING imperative and concrete
````

or

````
   Fixes #999 Describe the change made in a concise manner
   Closes #999 Describe the change made in a concise manner
````

* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
